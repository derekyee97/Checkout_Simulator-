# Checkout_Simulator-
Group collaboration to create a checkout system simulating a warehouse, stock, and user Interface system for online shopping. 
The "members.txt" file contains user account information. The corresponding  members python file puts the information into the database.
The snacks.txt file lists options the user can choose from when ordering through our UI. The snackFiles.py puts in the information into the database. 
The snackBY python file initializes all the tables and database that is used for the simulation.
The userInterface python file produces an organized menu with options to choose from like creating an account, logging in to shop, etc.
